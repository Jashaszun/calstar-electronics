This system is composed of the ground station, the antennas, and a computer. The ground station connects to the computer via USB and to the antennas, acting as the interface between the computer and the rocket. It has 2 status LEDs and 3 terminal blocks for digital input/output devices such as buttons or switches. The computer has (in progress) additional software for parsing and storing incoming data, and sending commands to the rocket.
