Git:
  - DO NOT PULL/MERGE
  - Instead, do a "git fetch" and "git rebase"
    - In the event of rebase conflicts, fix the conflict in the file then "git add filename" and "git rebase --continue"
    - This is so we don't have an insane mess of branches and merges in out git history
    - If you don't want to have to fetch and rebase every time, run "git config --local pull.rebase true" in the repo
    - Feel free to @Leo if you need help with conflicts

Code:
  - Set your editor to use two space soft tabs instead of hard tabs
    - It should do this automatically when editing a file with two space tabs
  - Initialize pointers like "int* foo;" NOT "int *foo;"
    - Because of this and readability, initialize only one variable per line
  - Should be obvious, but keep code out of .h files and declarations out of .cpp files (with the exception of helper functions only used in that .cpp file)

Programming:
  - If you experience an issue with the makefile when it comes to compiling or downloading code, let me (Leo) know
    - This is to avoid everyone having a separate compilation script that only works with their computer
