The instructions below for installing assume you have some familiarity with nodejs: if you don't, talk to Jonathan and he'll get you up to speed.

## Setting up
1. Install nodejs and npm (look this up if you don't know how)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Install [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download/) (this is the SQL server the OCF uses, and is compatible with MySQL libraries)
4. Run `mysql -uroot < setup.sql`; this initializes the database with a user and stuff.

## Running
1. <b>Start the SQL server</b> run `mysql.server start`, or whatever the docs tell you to do.
2. <b>Start the webserver</b> To start the webserver locally, run `npm start`. If you make any changes to server files, you'll need to ctrl-C and restart the server for the changes to take place. Make sure the SQL server is running.
3. To have client-side files update as you make changes, run `npm run watch`.
4. Visit `localhost:<port number>` in your web browser. The port number is 8000 for now.

## Style
### general
Make sure that you'll be able to understand what your code does 3 weeks from now, and make sure other people will be able to understand your code. To that end, please comment things as much as possible.
### js
Please adhere to the [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) conventions: (tl;dr 2 space indents, single quoted strings, no semicolonsâ€”if you feel really strongly about anything, please inform me as such and we can compromise). This is just for consistency and readability, and because I don't want to configure eslint.
Imports (from `require`) should be declared as `const`.
Feel free to rename the variables I gave in the skeleton code. Just make sure the variable names make sense are at least somewhat descriptive.
### sql
Capitalize keywords and lowercase names, e.g. `SELECT points FROM data`. For longer statements, try to put clauses like `FROM` and `WHERE` on their own lines for readability.

If the schema of a table exists and you want to change it, remember to change it in `setup.sql` with `ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS`.

USE PREPARED STATEMENTS (as opposed to string concatenating parameters into a query). They help avoid SQL injection attacks, and also undefined behavior.

### html
Please 2 space indent. I don't really have much else to say.

## Library docs
The following documentation pages may be useful:
- [loggy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loggy)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
If there's any other libraries I forgot to put down here, Google is your friend.

## TODO
(jonathan will assign these in a bit, stay tuned)
